   PROGRAM FILE                           PURPOSES
adjustments.c               Routines to adjust assigned atom types from gaff after
                            standard atom type assignment is completed.  Only used
                            with gaff force field.

                            correlations definitions.

compare_FF.c                Routines to compare amber and gaff type force field
                            data against assigned atom types of molecule.

                            atom type definition files and force field parameters
                            to assign gromacs or OPLS-AA atom types and set
                            appropriate parameters for a topology.
improper.c                  Routine to determine impropers
initializations.c           Defining declarations for external variables

                            assign atom types based on molecular structure
mainchain.c                 Routine to assign main chain of molecule.  Main
                            chain assignment is only used for atom renaming
                            (option -rename implementation).
molec_alloc.c               Routines to allocate and initialise storage for
                            molecule force field data.  Includes routine to
                            correct for residue order issues and to remove
                            zero mass particles.
param_tables.c              Routines to find angles and dihedrals, and to measure
                            bond lengths, angles, dihedrals, and impropers from
                            molecular coordinates.  Routine to correct inaccuracies
                            from dihedral measurements.  Routine to reassign some
                            dihedrals related to ring planarity to be impropers.
                            Routine to test dihedrals for desirability.
read_amber.c                Routines to read amber and gaff force field parameters
                            from the same style *.parm files used by leap, and to
                            free the storage allocated for these parameters.
read_tripos.c               Routines to read Tripos force field parameters from
                            TAFF* files and to free the storage allocated for
                            these parameters.  (Needed because some of the Tripos
                            force field entries differ from amber force field
                            entries.)
readmol2.c                  Routines to read and write Tripos style *.mol2 files,
                            to assign molecule storage, to perform a simple check
                            for structural correctness, and to determine atomic
                            numbers, masses, and symbols for atoms in the molecule.
rename.c                    Routine to use a set of rules based on Tripos atom
                            type and main chain assignment to revise atom naming
                            within a molecule.
ring_detect.c               Collection of routines to determine molecular ring
                            structure, atom electron withdrawing character,
                            aromaticity, and atom saturation.
set_similars.c              Routines to allocate, to free, and to set values from
                            atom correlation definitions in lists of similar atom
                            types for the molecule.  Used with gaff force field
                            data assignment.
topolbuild.c                Main program with subroutines to print version
                            information, to print usage information, and to handle
                            the calls needed for making assignments for gaff and
                            amber force fields.
use_amber.c                 Routines to handle the simplified comparisons needed to
                            assign amber force field parameters to atoms in a molecule.
use_gaff.c                  Routines to handle the handle series of comparisons,
                            including similar atom types comparisons, needed to
                            assign gaff force field parameters to atoms in a molecule.
use_tripos.c                Routines to handle the comparisons needed to assign
                            Tripos force field parameters to atoms in a molecule
                            including handling the specialized wild card types
                            found in Tripos force field files (ANY, HAL, HET, and
                            HEV)
utilities.c                 Character string manipulation utilities, utility for
                            input tokenization, type double fast inverse square
                            root, and type double fast cube root.
write_gro.c                 Routines to write the *.gro coordinates file and to
                            write the main parameters file for the topology *.top
