INSTALLATION:
Compilation has been tested on a G4 Power Macintosh running Os X 10.3.9
with both gcc version 3.3  20030304 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 1671), 
and with gcc version 4.1.0 as distributed by the Fink Project.

Two make files, that may need editing for individual systems, are included
as follows:
     Makefile                        Uses a standard C compiler with option -O
                                     to build the executable topolbuild
     Makefile.G4OsX                  Optimization set for a G4 Power Macintosh
                                     running Os X with optimization options
                                     -O2 -mcpu=7450 -mtune=970
To build topolbuild, type
     make
If you happen to have a Mac PowerPC G4 running Mac OS X, you can also type
     make -f Makefile.G4OsX
Otherwise, your system may require editing of the make file according to
the specifications of your systems C compiler and libraries to generate a
functional program.  Advice on such editing is best gotten from your own
technical support people.
