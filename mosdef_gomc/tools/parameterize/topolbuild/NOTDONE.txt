1. Implementation of angle restraints.
   From Tripos manuals, and from the description of angle
   restraints in the Gromacs manual, I'm not quite sure how
   Tripos angle restraints correspond to Gromacs angle restraints.
   Furthermore, I have not found the Gromacs format for angle
   restraints in the material I have.

2. Implementation of output in other topology formats.
   This requires writing routines to output in the correct
   format for the topology using the force field data
   assigned to the molecule.

3. Complete implementation of Ryckaert-Bellemans dihedrals.
   Correction of pairs output to skip pairs that are terminii of
   Ryckaert-Bellemans dihedral angles is not yet tested because
   none of the force fields implemented use Ryckaert-Bellemans
   dihedrals for which pairs are to be skipped (OPLS-AA's use
   wants pairs to be present as well).

4. Complete implementation of Urey-Bradley angle potentials.
   The force fields implemented so far do not include these.
   The additions to the angle potentials assignment and
   output code are included but have not been tested.

5. Implementation of all of the special defines given in
   OPLS-AA for dihedrals of various chemical species.
   Some of these are implemented by defining special atom
   types that are included as subsets or more general atom
   types, but this process is not yet complete.

6. Addition of other force fields.
   This should be a simple matter of writing an atom types
   definition file to define the atom types, and an appropriate
   force field parameters file.  The files provided should
   give sufficient guidance to do this.  Of course, making
   these tables is a substantial task.
   Once these are available, the name of the force field, its
   specific characteristics and defines, and a case entry in
   the switch statements for force field selection for assignment
   need to be added to topolbuild.c and the program can then
   be recompiled.
