HOW THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN TESTED TO THIS POINT:
1. Adenylate kinase coordinates 1AKE.pdb were read into Sybyl, and the AP5A ligand
   and "B" conformation in the crystal structure were deleted.  The remainder was
   written as a .pdb file.  This .pdb file was manually edited to remove references
   to a "B" orientation of NH1 and NH2 of Arg 167.  The resulting .pdb file was
   read into Sybyl and Gasteiger-Marsili charges were computed for protein.  The
   result was written as a .mol2 file.  The .mol2 file was processed with the
   command
        topolbuild -dir /local/antechamber-1.27 -ff gaff -n 1ake_a_only_a-arg -purge 1
   to generate a gromacs topology with the generalized Amber force field.  The
   non-bonded interactions file of the topology, ff1ake_a_only_a-argnb.itp, was
   edited to include sigma and epsilon parameters for MG.  The resulting topology
   was then processed for energy minimization in solvent with ions by the following
   gromacs commands:
        editconf -bt cubic -f 1ake_a_only_a-arg -o -d 0.85
        genbox -cp out -cs -p 1ake_a_only_a-arg -o use4em
        grompp -v -f em -c use4em -o doem -p 1ake_a_only_a-arg
        genion -s doem.tpr -o use4em_ions -pname K+ -np 4 -g add_ions
   At this point, 1ake_a_only_a-arg.top was edited to subtract 4 waters and add
   4 K+ to the list of molecules and the following gromacs commands were given:
        grompp -v -f em -c use4em_ions -o doem -p 1ake_a_only_a-arg
        mdrun -v -s doem -o emtrj -c after_em -g emlog >& emjob.txt
   The em.mdp file used was:

   Results were examined and viewed as above for the restrained MD run.

2. The same Sybyl generated .mol2 file used above was processed as follows to
   generate topologies with each of gromacs 53a6 parameters and oplsaa parameters:
        topolbuild -dir /local/topol_tables/dat/gromacs -ff gmx53a6 -n ../1ake_a_only_a-arg
        topolbuild -dir /local/topol_tables/dat/gromacs -ff oplsaa -n ../1ake_a_only_a-arg
   The atom type assignments in the resultant topologies were compared against
   the gromacs .rtp files for the respective force fields.

3. The .mol2 file of a minimized structure of MgATP with Gasteiger-Marsili charges
   was processed with the command
        topolbuild -dir /local/antechamber-1.27 -ff amber99 -n MgATP-R14K-chg -r ATP -meas -rename -purge 1 -move
   to generate a gromacs topology with the Amber 99 force field in which all bond
   lengths, angles, and torsions were determined from the coordinates, all atoms
   are renamed to give a more consistent naming structure, and the molecule is
   treated as a single residue with the residue name "ATP".  The resulting topology
   was then processed for energy minimization in vacuum with distance restraints by
   the following gromacs commands:
        grompp -v -f em -c out -o doem -p MgATP-R14K-chg
        mdrun -v -s doem -o emtrj -c after_em -g emlog

   The commands ran to completion without errors.  The structure after
   energy minimization was compared to the original structure minimized
   in Sybyl and showed minimal changes in conformation.

4. An oplsaa topology was generated for a MgATP .mol2 file with restraints
   and Gasteiger-Marsili charges with the command:
        topolbuild -dir /local/topol/dat/gromacs -ff oplsaa -n ../my_model1 -purge 1 -move
   The resulting topology was then processed for energy minimization in
   vacuum with distance restraints by the following gromacs commands:
        grompp_d -v -f em -c my_model1 -o my_model1 -p my_model1
        mdrun_d -deffnm my_model1

        Pcoupl              =  no
        gen_vel             =  no
   Dihedral angles were compared against those from the run listed in 3 above.

5. Topologies for tripos, amber99, gaff, gromacs 53a6, and oplsaa force fields
   were generated with a series of .mol2 files sent by users of prior versions
   of topolbuild after they had experienced difficulties with their files.
   Syntax had to be corrected in some of those files for them to be read.  After
   such corrections, each of these files generated topology files with each of the
   force fields.
