Warnings About Use of Any Automatic Topology Generator

Force fields do not have parameters in them for absolutely every
single combination of atom types possible.  This is true even for
universal force fields.  This is why the subject of parameterization
arises.

Automatic topology generation assigns parameters based on similarity
in structures.  This is not the same thing as full parameterization.
An automatic topology generator can only assign force field parameters
based on comparison of local portions of the structure submitted with
the characteristics of the atom types and parameters available in the
selected force field.  If a match does not exist, an automatic topology
generator cannot assign force field parameters for some combination
of atom types within a structure and might even be unable to assign
correct atom types.  If a match does exist, the force field parameters
assigned might still be incorrect because of further characteristics
of the structure that the limited region compared against in order to
assign atom types did not reflect.  Therefore, before using a topology
generated by any automatic topology generator, the user should be strongly
warned to check the topology carefully to be sure that the parameter
selections made are suitable.  This warning applies to every single
automatic topology generator, and not just topolbuild.
