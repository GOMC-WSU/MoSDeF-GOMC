.. note::
	**MoSDeF-GOMC**  uses the **MoSDeF** packages to build the chemical system, then **MoSDeF-GOMC**  generates all the required files to conduct a GOMC simulation. **NAMD** can also use the **MoSDeF-GOMC**  software to generate the system (PDB and PSF files) and force field files, provided they are single residue molecules and the user produces their own **NAMD**  control file.


The following examples are provided as a python file, as well as interactive `jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`_ notebooks for the simple examples.
