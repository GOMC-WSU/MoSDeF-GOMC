Traditional Chemical Engineering Systems
----------------------------------------

The `MoSDeF-GOMC software <https://github.com/GOMC-WSU/MoSDeF-GOMC>`_ is currently capable of
generating traditional chemical engineering systems that are not proteins or other molecules
requiring multiple residue names per molecule, covering various systems.
**MoSDeF-GOMC** only supports molecules with a single residue name and will support a protein if it has only one (1) residue name per molecule.
In the future, we plan to support these molecules, which require multiple residue names per molecule.



Non-Traditional Chemical Engineering Systems
--------------------------------------------

Non-traditional chemical engineering systems are proteins or other molecules requiring multiple residue names per molecule. Currently, the **MoSDeF-GOMC** software is not compatible with these systems.  Therefore, these systems should be constructed using different software, such as `Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) <https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/>`_, or other similar software.
